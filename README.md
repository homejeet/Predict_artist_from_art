# Predict_artist_from_art
This is case study on prediction of artist from given art using deep learning neural network.
Predicting artist from art paintings is a challenging task primarily handled by art historians with extensive training and expertise. Artist identification is the task of identifying the artist of a painting given no other information about it.This is important requirement for cataloguing art( make a systematic list of items of the same type), especially as art is increasingly digitized. Art work has growing collection with the aim of making all art easily available and accessible online.
